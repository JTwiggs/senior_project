## Info
**When and why did you start training for fighting?** I started eight years ago. My brother started training, and when he turned into a blue belt, I decided to join him since I saw him really enjoying it and liking the whole team.
**What ranks and titles have you held?** XFC tournament finalist, SFT champion, #15 ranked bantamweight in the world via FightMatrix.com
**Do you have any heroes?** My family and my master, Marcos “Babuino” Santos.
**What does it mean for you to fight in the UFC?** I started my career with a 1-2 pro record that quickly became a 3-4 pro record. A lot of people said I was never going to achieve anything in MMA and when I got pregnant, even more people told me to quit the sport and look for a job to keep my daughter as a single mom. I kept believing in my dream with the help of my family, my master and my team and managed to get on a 7-1 run in my last eight fights. It was hard, Brazilian MMA doesn’t pay much and in my fight in China the owner of the event did not pay the purses of the fighters and disappeared. To keep pushing and working hard being a single mom made me stronger than I ever thought I would be. Being now in the UFC and having the chance of giving a good life to my daughter and my family makes me the happiest person in the world. Nothing can take away what I felt when my manager called me to give me the news.
**Ranks in any martial arts styles:** Brown belt in BJJ, light blue belt in Muay Thai **Favorite grappling technique:** Armbar **Favorite Striking technique:** Left cross

  * One first round finish 
  * Has won seven of his last ten 
  * Owns 2017 KO win over UFC veteran Song Kenan 
  * Origin of nickname: “‘Quake’ was adopted by me from the constant earthquakes in my hometown of Christchurch. I feel it’s my name by right, having been through the sufferings with my people, having to have our homes destroyed and people dying and then having to constantly keep rebuilding the city. I feel I owe it to my city to rep them on the world stage and demonstrate their strength through me as they have shown through their strength by continuing to stay in Christchurch and call it home even after so many left. I also tend to knock my opponents out in MMA when I touch them, so this also relates nicely - getting hit by a human earthquake.”

**When and why did you start training for fighting?** I have always loved martial arts. I started when I was 17 in Muay Thai and kickboxing, then slowly made my way to MMA over the years. **What ranks and titles have you held?** Former WKBF world middleweight K-1 champion **What does it mean for you to fight in the UFC?** The UFC, for me, is the pinnacle of competition. Fighting here was a goal because I know the best and most skilled fighters are here, so this establishes me as one of them and that is the competition and challenge I want. **Did you go to college and if so what degree did you earn?** I went to university for about six months, then moved to Thailand to start my degree in martial arts; way better idea. **What was your job before you started fighting?** I used to hang dry wall (plaster board) in Auckland. **Specific accomplishments in amateur competition?** Amateur career was very limited; I had six fights, then turned pro. **Specific accomplishments in pro competition?** I won a world title, gained world rankings in the Top 10, fought the #1 ranked fighters for K-1 and Muay Thai in the world, beat some lost to some, it’s all part of the trip.

**When and why did you start training for fighting?** I started training years ago, as I’ve always liked MMA, so when a new gym opened up around the corner from my mother’s house I thought I would go down and try a class out. Next thing I know, I’m in the UFC.
**Training** : Either wrestling, jiu-jitsu or sparring in the morning at Renegade, then either pad work, strength and conditioning or bag work in the evening at various gyms in Wolverhampton. 
**What ranks and titles have you held?** I am the former Cage Warriors lightweight champion, which is the most prestigious title to hold in Europe. 
**What does it mean for you to fight in the UFC?** It’s what I’ve trained and fought for over the last seven years, and to finally get in the UFC is amazing, but this now is the start of my legacy. 
**What was your job before you started fighting?** I was a scaffolder for 14 years and I only quit the job a month ago to fully concentrate on my UFC career. 
**Specific accomplishments in amateur competition?** In my amateur career I won the Combat Challenge British welterweight title and the BCMMA British lightweight title. 
**Ranks in any martial arts styles:** BJJ blue belt under Renegade Jiu-Jitsu 
**Favorite grappling technique:** Rear naked choke 
**Favorite Striking technique:** Left hook to the body (liver shot)

**When and why did you start training for fighting?** I started fighting because I was always the smallest, getting pushed around, but there came a time when I wasn’t wrestling anymore and I was in college and I got jumped by two people on my 19th birthday and realized that it was my true calling.
**Training** : I wake up, wrestle for an hour, do mitts, and then jump on the treadmill. Then I take a lunch break and go to team training from 3 to 5pm.**What ranks and titles have you held?** BJJ purple belt**What does it mean for you to fight in the UFC?** A UFC contract means that I’m finally getting what I have earned. I have been through a lot more than any of these Contender Series guys. I have had my career almost taken from me when I broke my jaw, and I am more because of it. I try not to brag about it because it hit on a deeper level with my family and everyone that was there when it happened that life isn’t promised, so you better get it done today before time runs out because it’s not an endless clock.**What was your job before you started fighting?** Cut grass and whooped ass. **Specific accomplishments in amateur competition?** Featherweight state champion and Caged Kombat champion, Arena Combat champion (amateur accomplishments)

  * Pro since 2017 
  * Has won four of his last six 
  * Eight wins by KO, one by submission (Guillotine) 
  * Seven first round finishes 
  * Reported 12-3 amateur record 
  * Origin of nickname: “I got the ‘Khaos’ nickname when I was 13 because I always used to fight and get in trouble when I was little and people started calling me that because they said every time I’m around I’m causing chaos. I put the K on it to make ‘Khaos’ because my name starts with a K. The ox came about from wrestling around and slap boxing with my friends. They'd joke and say I’m strong like an ox, so when I started fighting I just came up with ‘Oxfighter’ because I’m a fighter and it’s got a ring to it.”

**When and why did you start training for fighting?** I started training in September 2013 and had my first fight three months later. I started because someone seen me fight and told me that I had it. So I found a BJJ gym and just fell in love after my first bout. I jumped into the sport with some blind faith but I put the work in and now I got people all around the world telling me it’s my time.
**Training** : Wake up 4:30am, do my calisthenics, run five miles at 5am and do some wing chun drills three days out of the week at 7:30 for an hour. The other days it’s strength and conditioning. 12-1 I take a nap, then hit the MMA gym at 5-7. The days I’m not in the MMA gym I’m at my jiu-jitsu gym or boxing gym. The days I’m not working wing chun I’m working my hands with my boxing coach. The schedule mixes up and gets unorthodox closer to the fights.**What ranks and titles have you held?** I'm three-stripe blue belt in jiu-jitsu and I have the professional TWC super lightweight championship.**Do you have any heroes?** Jay-Z, Meek Mill, Jon Jones and Kobe Bryant rest in peace.**What does it mean for you to fight in the UFC?** It means the world to me to be in the UFC and I'm excited to be great and do great things.**Did you go to college and if so what degree did you earn?** Yes, I went to college but I ended up dropping out and started training full-time.**Specific accomplishments in amateur competition?** Amateur MMA champion**Specific accomplishments in pro competition?** I fought in Beijing, China and won in 24 seconds with a knockout. I won my first professional title at 5-1 against a vet with over 35 fights.**Favorite grappling technique:** Guillotine**Favorite Striking technique:** Whatever I see

**When and why did you start training for fighting?** As far as I can remember, I always thought about myself as a fighter. I used to fight at school as a kid, then, when I had to leave my country to go to Russia for work, I was still training along with my hard work. I kept on working on my fighting dream. **What ranks and titles have you held?** Now I am number one in middleweight in Eastern Europe (Tapology). I hold a few belt titles (XFN, Caveam, WKN) **Do you have any heroes?** My mum and dad are my heroes, but if you mean motivation, my biggest motivation is my TMT brother Floyd Mayweather **What does it mean for you to fight in the UFC?** It means the world to me - cliché, I know, but it is true. An opportunity to fight for the UFC is my “dream came true” thing. **Did you go to college and if so what degree did you earn?** I wasn’t able to go to college. I had to work since I was a teenager because of my father’s injury. I am taking care of my family since then until now. **What was your job before you started fighting?** I started with helping to build houses and skycrapers, then working on “doors” in night clubs for many years. **Ranks in any martial arts styles:** As I said, I am a complex fighter; I am good in everything **Favorite grappling technique:** What comes comes, and I use it. I don’t prefer any. **Favorite Striking technique:** I am used to putting pressure on and moving forward.

**UFC History**
**UFC 258** (2/13/21) Martin was submitted by Polyana Viana via armbar at 3:18 of the first round **UFC Fight Night** (8/29/20) Martin submitted Hannah Cifers via rear naked choke at 1:33 of the second round **UFC on ESPN** (12/7/19) Martin was submitted by Virna Jandiroba via rear naked choke at 1:16 of the second round
**_Dana White's Contender Series,_ Season 3 Episode 9** (8/20/19) Martin won a three round unanimous decision over Micol De Segni
**Q &A**
**When and why did you start training for fighting?** I started training to become a professional fighter after watching UFC on TV. I’ve always been very aggressive and played multiple sports. **What ranks and titles have you held?** I’m currently a BJJ brown belt. I had an amateur 115 belt for Sparta Combat League. I also won the 2016 Tiger Muay Thai tryouts, winning a scholarship to train there for free. **Do you have any heroes?** My father is my hero. He showed me what true strength is and how to be strong. He may have lost his battle to cancer but he never stopped fighting, and I keep that with me. Losing him made me the person and fighter I am today, so he’s my hero and he always believed in me and that’ll never be forgotten. **What does it mean for you to fight in the UFC?** It means a lot for me to become a fighter for the UFC. This is the top promotion - the best in the world - so to fight in the UFC is life changing. I truly believe that’s where I belong. **Did you go to college and if so what degree did you earn?** No college. I started training in high school and kept with it. **What was your job before you started fighting?** Afterschool daycare site lead **Favorite grappling technique:** Rear naked choke **Favorite striking technique:** Cross

**Personal Life/Background:** I was born in Lithuania, moved to the UK when I was 3 and spent 2 years in high school in Louisiana.

## Info
**When and why did you start training for fighting?** First amateur fight was April 2011. I lost, but it lit a fire under my ass and it kept me focused and healthy. Lots of people like to drink and do opiates, I’m not kidding. I like to stay active and healthy and fighting is what keeps me going and feeling alive. Some people will never know what it’s like to fight another human being and they are content behind a desk making other people a lot of money. And that was not the life for me. This is my true vocation / calling / passion.
**What does it mean for you to fight in the UFC?** Fighting in the UFC confirms that I have been dedicating my life to the right path and to being the best version of myself mentally, spiritually and physically. Fighting is the externalization of the battles we all deal with internally, and by applying the same lessons of the fight game to real life, it allows us to see that anything is possible with the right attitude and frame of mind.
**Did you go to college and if so what degree did you earn?** I went to Regis University in Denver, CO. I graduated with a dual BS degree in Business Management and Marketing. 
**What was your job before you started fighting?** I was a buyer for a wholesale company and an account manager. 
**Specific accomplishments in amateur competition?** Cage Titans amateur featherweight champ
**Ranks in any martial arts styles:** Purple belt (Gi BJJ) under Gracie black belts Juliano “Banana” Coutinho & “Loco Lobo” Mike Gresh. I’m now training under Joe Lauzon (no gi).
**Favorite grappling technique:** A fierce ground-and-pound by reigning hellish elbows from above that would make any drone strike jealous
**Favorite striking technique:** HIGHLY CALCULATED VIOLENCE

**When and why did you start training for fighting?** I always watched a lot of fight movies when I was a kid like The Big White Dragon (Bloodsport in the U.S.) I think this was one of the most memorable films for me and as a teenager I started to see VHS MMA fights like the first UFC and that desire to be a fighter was growing every day. I practiced the sport more at 17 years old when I had the opportunity to train jiu-jitsu, and from then on, I never stopped and I did my first MMA fight at 19 years old. **What ranks and titles have you held?** I was Brazilian champion for Bitetti Combate in 2013 and in 2018 I was champion of the Professional Fighters League (PFL), which was the most important achievement of my career so far. **Do you have any heroes?** I’m a man of faith and Jesus Christ is my hero. **What does it mean for you to fight in the UFC?** Fighting in the UFC is the realization of a dream, of a goal that I started many years ago. It reminds me of when I watched those UFC fights on VHS and said to myself, “One day I will be fighting there.” So all the hard work, effort, dedication, it was worth it, and it will be worth a lot more. I know I just got to UFC and I have a lot of work to do, but as I said, I am a man of faith and I believe I will do a great job in the organization. **Did you go to college and if so what degree did you earn?** I studied before entering the university. **What was your job before you started fighting?** I worked as a salesman early in my MMA career. **Favorite grappling technique:** Rear naked choke **Favorite Striking technique:** I like to use my hands to win the fights.

**When and why did you start training for fighting?** I have been fighting and training martial arts my entire life. My dad was a Tae Kwon Do instructor for about 30-plus years so I started taking Tae Kwon Do when I was about 3 or 4 years old. Throughout my entire childhood, we watched the UFC, along with many other fighting movies, back when the UFC and PRIDE were pretty much the only known MMA promotions in the world. I trained and competed in TKD until I started wrestling in the sixth grade. I then wrestled from sixth grade all the way through college. Throughout that time, I would always make my friends glove up and fight me in my backyard and at my dad’s TKD academy after hours. Not long after I graduated college in 2013, I finally got the opportunity to actually train MMA when I found Tech MMA & Fitness Academy in 2014, which was referred by a childhood friend. I trained for about two months before having my first amateur MMA fight. I had seven amateur fights before turning pro at the end of 2015. At the beginning of 2016, I decided to quit my job in order to train full-time and have been a full-time fighter ever since. Fighting has always been a part of my life and ever since I was a child, I have always had aspirations of being a UFC fighter. **What ranks and titles have you held?** CES bantamweight world champion, KOTC bantamweight world champion, PA Cage Fight champion **Do you have any heroes?** My parents and my wife are my heroes. My parents have always believed in me and supported everything that I’ve done throughout my entire life. I realize there are a lot of people in the world that don’t have both of their parents so I’m even more grateful for them; not just to have them but to have the best parents anyone could ever ask for. My wife is also my hero. Without her love and support, this dream wouldn’t have come into fruition so quickly. She takes care of pretty much everything financially just so I can continue to pursue this dream and train full-time. On top of that, she always cooks the things I need to fuel my body for a hard day of training and sacrifices so much more so we can make my dream become a reality. I’m extremely fortunate to have such tremendous support in my life. **What does it mean for you to fight in the UFC?** To me, fighting in the UFC means that I’ve fulfilled my destiny. When I was in elementary school, I told myself that I would fight in the UFC. Growing up in a martial arts household, everything that I watched and played with was fight related, so fighting is all I’ve ever known. The 20-plus years of combat sports that I’ve competed in have prepared me for this amazing opportunity. **Did you go to college and if so what degree did you earn?** I attended and wrestled at Appalachian State University in Boone, North Carolina and received a Bachelor of Science degree in Building Sciences with a concentration in Construction Management. **What was your job before you started fighting?** Before I started fighting, I was a Construction Project Manager for a concrete contractor. **Specific accomplishments in amateur competition?** Amateur MMA: CageZilla bantamweight champion (Virginia), Fight Lab bantamweight champion (North Carolina), High School Wrestling: 2x Virginia High School State champion, 3x High School All-American, College Wrestling: 2x NCAA Division I Southern Conference Champion, 2x NCAA Division I National Qualifier **Ranks in any martial arts styles:** Purple belt in BJJ, black belt in Tae Kwon Do, NCAA Division I college wrestler **Favorite grappling technique:** Slams **Favorite striking technique:** Elbows and right hands

## Info
**When and why did you start training for fighting?** I started eight years ago. My brother started training, and when he turned into a blue belt, I decided to join him since I saw him really enjoying it and liking the whole team.
**What ranks and titles have you held?** XFC tournament finalist, SFT champion, #15 ranked bantamweight in the world via FightMatrix.com
**Do you have any heroes?** My family and my master, Marcos “Babuino” Santos.
**What does it mean for you to fight in the UFC?** I started my career with a 1-2 pro record that quickly became a 3-4 pro record. A lot of people said I was never going to achieve anything in MMA and when I got pregnant, even more people told me to quit the sport and look for a job to keep my daughter as a single mom. I kept believing in my dream with the help of my family, my master and my team and managed to get on a 7-1 run in my last eight fights. It was hard, Brazilian MMA doesn’t pay much and in my fight in China the owner of the event did not pay the purses of the fighters and disappeared. To keep pushing and working hard being a single mom made me stronger than I ever thought I would be. Being now in the UFC and having the chance of giving a good life to my daughter and my family makes me the happiest person in the world. Nothing can take away what I felt when my manager called me to give me the news.
**Ranks in any martial arts styles:** Brown belt in BJJ, light blue belt in Muay Thai **Favorite grappling technique:** Armbar **Favorite Striking technique:** Left cross

  * Five wins by KO 
  * One first round finish 
  * Has won seven of his last ten 
  * Owns 2017 KO win over UFC veteran Song Kenan 
  * Origin of nickname: “‘Quake’ was adopted by me from the constant earthquakes in my hometown of Christchurch. I feel it’s my name by right, having been through the sufferings with my people, having to have our homes destroyed and people dying and then having to constantly keep rebuilding the city. I feel I owe it to my city to rep them on the world stage and demonstrate their strength through me as they have shown through their strength by continuing to stay in Christchurch and call it home even after so many left. I also tend to knock my opponents out in MMA when I touch them, so this also relates nicely - getting hit by a human earthquake.”

**When and why did you start training for fighting?** I have always loved martial arts. I started when I was 17 in Muay Thai and kickboxing, then slowly made my way to MMA over the years. **What ranks and titles have you held?** Former WKBF world middleweight K-1 champion **What does it mean for you to fight in the UFC?** The UFC, for me, is the pinnacle of competition. Fighting here was a goal because I know the best and most skilled fighters are here, so this establishes me as one of them and that is the competition and challenge I want. **Did you go to college and if so what degree did you earn?** I went to university for about six months, then moved to Thailand to start my degree in martial arts; way better idea. **What was your job before you started fighting?** I used to hang dry wall (plaster board) in Auckland. **Specific accomplishments in amateur competition?** Amateur career was very limited; I had six fights, then turned pro. **Specific accomplishments in pro competition?** I won a world title, gained world rankings in the Top 10, fought the #1 ranked fighters for K-1 and Muay Thai in the world, beat some lost to some, it’s all part of the trip. I fought for ONE FC, was able to live as a professional fighter in a country where the sport is a major minority. I’ve lived a life that not many will live or have lived. These are my accomplishments. **Favorite grappling technique:** Heel hook **Favorite Striking technique:** Left hook or left body rip

**When and why did you start training for fighting?** I started training years ago, as I’ve always liked MMA, so when a new gym opened up around the corner from my mother’s house I thought I would go down and try a class out. Next thing I know, I’m in the UFC.
**Training** : Either wrestling, jiu-jitsu or sparring in the morning at Renegade, then either pad work, strength and conditioning or bag work in the evening at various gyms in Wolverhampton. 
**What ranks and titles have you held?** I am the former Cage Warriors lightweight champion, which is the most prestigious title to hold in Europe. 
**What does it mean for you to fight in the UFC?** It’s what I’ve trained and fought for over the last seven years, and to finally get in the UFC is amazing, but this now is the start of my legacy. 
**What was your job before you started fighting?** I was a scaffolder for 14 years and I only quit the job a month ago to fully concentrate on my UFC career. 
**Specific accomplishments in amateur competition?** In my amateur career I won the Combat Challenge British welterweight title and the BCMMA British lightweight title. 
**Ranks in any martial arts styles:** BJJ blue belt under Renegade Jiu-Jitsu 
**Favorite grappling technique:** Rear naked choke 
**Favorite Striking technique:** Left hook to the body (liver shot)

**When and why did you start training for fighting?** I started fighting because I was always the smallest, getting pushed around, but there came a time when I wasn’t wrestling anymore and I was in college and I got jumped by two people on my 19th birthday and realized that it was my true calling.
**Training** : I wake up, wrestle for an hour, do mitts, and then jump on the treadmill. Then I take a lunch break and go to team training from 3 to 5pm.**What ranks and titles have you held?** BJJ purple belt**What does it mean for you to fight in the UFC?** A UFC contract means that I’m finally getting what I have earned. I have been through a lot more than any of these Contender Series guys. I have had my career almost taken from me when I broke my jaw, and I am more because of it. I try not to brag about it because it hit on a deeper level with my family and everyone that was there when it happened that life isn’t promised, so you better get it done today before time runs out because it’s not an endless clock.**What was your job before you started fighting?** Cut grass and whooped ass. **Specific accomplishments in amateur competition?** Featherweight state champion and Caged Kombat champion, Arena Combat champion (amateur accomplishments)

  * Seven first round finishes 
  * Reported 12-3 amateur record 
  * Origin of nickname: “I got the ‘Khaos’ nickname when I was 13 because I always used to fight and get in trouble when I was little and people started calling me that because they said every time I’m around I’m causing chaos. I put the K on it to make ‘Khaos’ because my name starts with a K. The ox came about from wrestling around and slap boxing with my friends. They'd joke and say I’m strong like an ox, so when I started fighting I just came up with ‘Oxfighter’ because I’m a fighter and it’s got a ring to it.”

**When and why did you start training for fighting?** I started training in September 2013 and had my first fight three months later. I started because someone seen me fight and told me that I had it. So I found a BJJ gym and just fell in love after my first bout. I jumped into the sport with some blind faith but I put the work in and now I got people all around the world telling me it’s my time.
**Training** : Wake up 4:30am, do my calisthenics, run five miles at 5am and do some wing chun drills three days out of the week at 7:30 for an hour. The other days it’s strength and conditioning. 12-1 I take a nap, then hit the MMA gym at 5-7. The days I’m not in the MMA gym I’m at my jiu-jitsu gym or boxing gym. The days I’m not working wing chun I’m working my hands with my boxing coach. The schedule mixes up and gets unorthodox closer to the fights.**What ranks and titles have you held?** I'm three-stripe blue belt in jiu-jitsu and I have the professional TWC super lightweight championship.**Do you have any heroes?** Jay-Z, Meek Mill, Jon Jones and Kobe Bryant rest in peace.**What does it mean for you to fight in the UFC?** It means the world to me to be in the UFC and I'm excited to be great and do great things.**Did you go to college and if so what degree did you earn?** Yes, I went to college but I ended up dropping out and started training full-time.**Specific accomplishments in amateur competition?** Amateur MMA champion**Specific accomplishments in pro competition?** I fought in Beijing, China and won in 24 seconds with a knockout. I won my first professional title at 5-1 against a vet with over 35 fights.**Favorite grappling technique:** Guillotine**Favorite Striking technique:** Whatever I see

I also won a silver and a bronze and competed on the national team for five years. **Favorite grappling technique:** Single and double leg takedowns. I find wrestling to be the most fun of everything I train. **Favorite Striking technique** : Elbows and knees.

**When and why did you start training for fighting?** As far as I can remember, I always thought about myself as a fighter. I used to fight at school as a kid, then, when I had to leave my country to go to Russia for work, I was still training along with my hard work. I kept on working on my fighting dream. **What ranks and titles have you held?** Now I am number one in middleweight in Eastern Europe (Tapology). I hold a few belt titles (XFN, Caveam, WKN) **Do you have any heroes?** My mum and dad are my heroes, but if you mean motivation, my biggest motivation is my TMT brother Floyd Mayweather **What does it mean for you to fight in the UFC?** It means the world to me - cliché, I know, but it is true. An opportunity to fight for the UFC is my “dream came true” thing. **Did you go to college and if so what degree did you earn?** I wasn’t able to go to college. I had to work since I was a teenager because of my father’s injury. I am taking care of my family since then until now. **What was your job before you started fighting?** I started with helping to build houses and skycrapers, then working on “doors” in night clubs for many years. **Ranks in any martial arts styles:** As I said, I am a complex fighter; I am good in everything **Favorite grappling technique:** What comes comes, and I use it. I don’t prefer any. **Favorite Striking technique:** I am used to putting pressure on and moving forward.

**Q &A**
**When and why did you start training for fighting?** I started training to become a professional fighter after watching UFC on TV. I’ve always been very aggressive and played multiple sports. **What ranks and titles have you held?** I’m currently a BJJ brown belt. I had an amateur 115 belt for Sparta Combat League. I also won the 2016 Tiger Muay Thai tryouts, winning a scholarship to train there for free. **Do you have any heroes?** My father is my hero. He showed me what true strength is and how to be strong. He may have lost his battle to cancer but he never stopped fighting, and I keep that with me. Losing him made me the person and fighter I am today, so he’s my hero and he always believed in me and that’ll never be forgotten. **What does it mean for you to fight in the UFC?** It means a lot for me to become a fighter for the UFC. This is the top promotion - the best in the world - so to fight in the UFC is life changing. I truly believe that’s where I belong. **Did you go to college and if so what degree did you earn?** No college. I started training in high school and kept with it. **What was your job before you started fighting?** Afterschool daycare site lead **Favorite grappling technique:** Rear naked choke **Favorite striking technique:** Cross

## Info
**When and why did you start training for fighting?** First amateur fight was April 2011. I lost, but it lit a fire under my ass and it kept me focused and healthy. Lots of people like to drink and do opiates, I’m not kidding. I like to stay active and healthy and fighting is what keeps me going and feeling alive. Some people will never know what it’s like to fight another human being and they are content behind a desk making other people a lot of money. And that was not the life for me. This is my true vocation / calling / passion.
**What does it mean for you to fight in the UFC?** Fighting in the UFC confirms that I have been dedicating my life to the right path and to being the best version of myself mentally, spiritually and physically. Fighting is the externalization of the battles we all deal with internally, and by applying the same lessons of the fight game to real life, it allows us to see that anything is possible with the right attitude and frame of mind.
**Did you go to college and if so what degree did you earn?** I went to Regis University in Denver, CO. I graduated with a dual BS degree in Business Management and Marketing. 
**What was your job before you started fighting?** I was a buyer for a wholesale company and an account manager. 
**Specific accomplishments in amateur competition?** Cage Titans amateur featherweight champ
**Ranks in any martial arts styles:** Purple belt (Gi BJJ) under Gracie black belts Juliano “Banana” Coutinho & “Loco Lobo” Mike Gresh. I’m now training under Joe Lauzon (no gi).
**Favorite grappling technique:** A fierce ground-and-pound by reigning hellish elbows from above that would make any drone strike jealous
**Favorite striking technique:** HIGHLY CALCULATED VIOLENCE

**When and why did you start training for fighting?** I always watched a lot of fight movies when I was a kid like The Big White Dragon (Bloodsport in the U.S.) I think this was one of the most memorable films for me and as a teenager I started to see VHS MMA fights like the first UFC and that desire to be a fighter was growing every day. I practiced the sport more at 17 years old when I had the opportunity to train jiu-jitsu, and from then on, I never stopped and I did my first MMA fight at 19 years old. **What ranks and titles have you held?** I was Brazilian champion for Bitetti Combate in 2013 and in 2018 I was champion of the Professional Fighters League (PFL), which was the most important achievement of my career so far. **Do you have any heroes?** I’m a man of faith and Jesus Christ is my hero. **What does it mean for you to fight in the UFC?** Fighting in the UFC is the realization of a dream, of a goal that I started many years ago. It reminds me of when I watched those UFC fights on VHS and said to myself, “One day I will be fighting there.” So all the hard work, effort, dedication, it was worth it, and it will be worth a lot more. I know I just got to UFC and I have a lot of work to do, but as I said, I am a man of faith and I believe I will do a great job in the organization. **Did you go to college and if so what degree did you earn?** I studied before entering the university. **What was your job before you started fighting?** I worked as a salesman early in my MMA career. **Favorite grappling technique:** Rear naked choke **Favorite Striking technique:** I like to use my hands to win the fights.

**When and why did you start training for fighting?** I have been fighting and training martial arts my entire life. My dad was a Tae Kwon Do instructor for about 30-plus years so I started taking Tae Kwon Do when I was about 3 or 4 years old. Throughout my entire childhood, we watched the UFC, along with many other fighting movies, back when the UFC and PRIDE were pretty much the only known MMA promotions in the world. I trained and competed in TKD until I started wrestling in the sixth grade. I then wrestled from sixth grade all the way through college. Throughout that time, I would always make my friends glove up and fight me in my backyard and at my dad’s TKD academy after hours. Not long after I graduated college in 2013, I finally got the opportunity to actually train MMA when I found Tech MMA & Fitness Academy in 2014, which was referred by a childhood friend. I trained for about two months before having my first amateur MMA fight. I had seven amateur fights before turning pro at the end of 2015. At the beginning of 2016, I decided to quit my job in order to train full-time and have been a full-time fighter ever since. Fighting has always been a part of my life and ever since I was a child, I have always had aspirations of being a UFC fighter. **What ranks and titles have you held?** CES bantamweight world champion, KOTC bantamweight world champion, PA Cage Fight champion **Do you have any heroes?** My parents and my wife are my heroes. My parents have always believed in me and supported everything that I’ve done throughout my entire life. I realize there are a lot of people in the world that don’t have both of their parents so I’m even more grateful for them; not just to have them but to have the best parents anyone could ever ask for. My wife is also my hero. Without her love and support, this dream wouldn’t have come into fruition so quickly. She takes care of pretty much everything financially just so I can continue to pursue this dream and train full-time. On top of that, she always cooks the things I need to fuel my body for a hard day of training and sacrifices so much more so we can make my dream become a reality. I’m extremely fortunate to have such tremendous support in my life. **What does it mean for you to fight in the UFC?** To me, fighting in the UFC means that I’ve fulfilled my destiny. When I was in elementary school, I told myself that I would fight in the UFC. Growing up in a martial arts household, everything that I watched and played with was fight related, so fighting is all I’ve ever known. The 20-plus years of combat sports that I’ve competed in have prepared me for this amazing opportunity. **Did you go to college and if so what degree did you earn?** I attended and wrestled at Appalachian State University in Boone, North Carolina and received a Bachelor of Science degree in Building Sciences with a concentration in Construction Management. **What was your job before you started fighting?** Before I started fighting, I was a Construction Project Manager for a concrete contractor. **Specific accomplishments in amateur competition?** Amateur MMA: CageZilla bantamweight champion (Virginia), Fight Lab bantamweight champion (North Carolina), High School Wrestling: 2x Virginia High School State champion, 3x High School All-American, College Wrestling: 2x NCAA Division I Southern Conference Champion, 2x NCAA Division I National Qualifier **Ranks in any martial arts styles:** Purple belt in BJJ, black belt in Tae Kwon Do, NCAA Division I college wrestler **Favorite grappling technique:** Slams **Favorite striking technique:** Elbows and right hands

## Info
**When and why did you start training for fighting?** I started eight years ago. My brother started training, and when he turned into a blue belt, I decided to join him since I saw him really enjoying it and liking the whole team.
**What ranks and titles have you held?** XFC tournament finalist, SFT champion, #15 ranked bantamweight in the world via FightMatrix.com
**Do you have any heroes?** My family and my master, Marcos “Babuino” Santos.
**What does it mean for you to fight in the UFC?** I started my career with a 1-2 pro record that quickly became a 3-4 pro record. A lot of people said I was never going to achieve anything in MMA and when I got pregnant, even more people told me to quit the sport and look for a job to keep my daughter as a single mom. I kept believing in my dream with the help of my family, my master and my team and managed to get on a 7-1 run in my last eight fights. It was hard, Brazilian MMA doesn’t pay much and in my fight in China the owner of the event did not pay the purses of the fighters and disappeared. To keep pushing and working hard being a single mom made me stronger than I ever thought I would be. Being now in the UFC and having the chance of giving a good life to my daughter and my family makes me the happiest person in the world. Nothing can take away what I felt when my manager called me to give me the news.
**Ranks in any martial arts styles:** Brown belt in BJJ, light blue belt in Muay Thai **Favorite grappling technique:** Armbar **Favorite Striking technique:** Left cross
